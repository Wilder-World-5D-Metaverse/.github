## 🌀 What is Wilder World?

Wilder World is a hyper-realistic 5D metaverse built on Ethereum and Unreal Engine 5. It combines NFT-based identity, racing, real estate, and art into a shared digital universe where players can explore, socialize, trade, and compete. Each car, sneaker, avatar, and apartment is tokenized — giving full ownership and tradability in the Wilder ecosystem.

You don’t just play — you live and earn in Wilder World.
